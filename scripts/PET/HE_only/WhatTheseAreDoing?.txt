WHAT THESE SCRIPTS ARE DOING - FAULTTOLERNACEFEDAVG in this case?

It seems like you have shared a script for a Federated Learning setup using a Fault Tolerant Federated Averaging (FaultTolerantFedAvg) approach. The script includes the implementation of a simple Keras model, encryption and decryption functions using TenSEAL, as well as data loading and training processes for federated clients. The main steps involved are:

1. **Model Definition**: Creation of a simple Keras model with specified architecture and metrics.
2. **Encryption and Decryption Functions**: Functions to encrypt and decrypt model data using TenSEAL.
3. **Homomorphic Model Update Function**: Updating the global model with encrypted local models.
4. **FaultTolerantFedAvg Function**: Performing Fault Tolerant Federated Averaging on encrypted local models.
5. **Loading Dataset**: Loading the dataset from a filesystem.
6. **Federated Learning Process**: Simulating federated clients, training local models, evaluating metrics, and aggregating models using FaultTolerantFedAvg.
7. **Metrics Logging**: Recording various metrics like training time, accuracy, and aggregation time.
8. **Error Handling**: Handling exceptions that may occur during the process.
9. **Saving Metrics**: Storing the collected metrics in a CSV file for analysis.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the script, feel free to ask!
